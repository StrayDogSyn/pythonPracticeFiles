# Key Terms
# Algorithm: A step-by-step procedure for calculations.
# Algorithmic Thinking: The ability to define clear steps to solve a problem.
# Problem Decomposition: Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts.
# Time Complexity: A measure of the time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input.
# Space Complexity: A measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs.
# Big O Notation: A mathematical notation to describe the upper limit of an algorithm's time or space complexity.
# Iteration: The repetition of a process in a computer program, often used in loops.
# Recursion: A method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
# Brute Force: A straightforward approach to solving a problem, typically involving checking all possible solutions.
# Optimization: The process of making a system or design as effective or functional as possible.
# Greedy Algorithm: An algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.
# Divide and Conquer: An algorithm design paradigm that works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.
# Dynamic Programming: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant work.
# Backtracking: An algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.
#Pseudocode: A method of designing algorithms using a structured but plain language that resembles programming languages, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading.
# Flowchart: A diagram that represents a process or algorithm, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds and their order by connecting them with arrows.
# Control Flow: The order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated in a program.
# Data Structure: A particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
